[Steps setup up hadoop cluster using Odroid XU4/XU3Lite]

Overall instruction here: http://diybigdata.net/odroid-xu4-cluster/

Step done: 

1. Setup LAN cluster; Master node acts as a DHCP server; Ubuntu 16.06: 
	http://diybigdata.net/2017/11/upgrading-odroid-cluster-to-ubuntu-16-04/
	* boot.ini is editable when reading the EMMC module via SD card reader. There we can modify the ENV MAC address (of the eth0 ethernet interface)
	* Note that all nodes must have unique mac addr, otherwise can't ssh between them
	* /etc/hosts: Assign "127.0.0.1" only to "localhost". If assign it to "master/slavexx", then run into issue that slave cannot communicate with master
	* on master /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf: master/dhcp server assigns static IP to slave nodes based on the slave's ethernet interface mac addr
	
2. Install hadoop on cluster
	http://diybigdata.net/2016/06/installing-hadoop-onto-an-odroid-xu4-cluster/#starting-hdfs
	* There's no need for nfs-common / nfs mount
	* These are files to rsync from master to slaves:
		/etc/hosts
		~/.bashrc
		/opt/hadoop (hadoop installation)
	* Quick test network speed between 2 nodes: https://askubuntu.com/questions/7976/how-do-you-test-the-network-speed-between-two-boxes
		
		
Next todo:
1. Install and run Spark jobs
2. Write real world map-reduce jobs
3. Take a look into QFS (Quantcast File System)
